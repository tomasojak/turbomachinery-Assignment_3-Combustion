# Combustion Assignement for the 2025-26 Turbomachinery Course

## Preliminary preparations
Before starting the assignement, you need to install a Python distribution on your machine. 
You can do so by following the instructions given [here](./installation_instructions.md). 
If you do not want or are not able to install a Python distribution on your PC, 
you may run the code directly by using an online IDE, such as [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), 
[Online Python](https://www.online-python.com/) or [PyTogether](https://pytogether.org/).
